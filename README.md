# Introduction

This repository holds the Chair's Issue Tracker.

This is used by the chairs (and sometimes AD) to keep track of the state of the documents, track what the next steps are, who has the action (authors, chairs, AD, etc).
This should only be edited by the chairs, and is informational for participants...

**Note**: This is done as an experiment / to gain some experiance with this design - hopefully, once we have worked out the workflow we will ask for this sort of functionality to be integrated into the Datatracker...
